# NLTK

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating the use of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of natural language processing concepts

## Installation

To get started with NLTK:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

After installation, you will need to download the necessary datasets and corpora:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('popular')
```

## Example - Basic Text Processing

This example demonstrates some basic text processing functionalities such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging using NLTK.

### `basic_text_processing.py`

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag

# Sample text
text = "NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data."

# Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print("Tokens:", tokens)

# Part-of-Speech Tagging
tagged = pos_tag(tokens)
print("POS Tags:", tagged)
```
